                Hello, I am very pleased that you are taking the time to look at my Portfolio. It is my pleasure to
                share it with you.
                This is what I have learned over the past 9 months. I retired from AT&T in 2017, took a year to travel
                and work around the house.
                Then, I decided to go back to school to learn how to code so that I could start my second career.

                Core Qualifications

            <article>
                My Core Qualifications are that I am honest, dependable and hard working (although I pride myself on working smarter NOT harder).
                I will be able to pass a
                background check and drug test anytime, anywhere.
                I have learned the basics of HTML5, CSS, C#, JavaScript, SQLite, .Net and .NetCore. I have used Trello, Azure,
                Visual Studio and Postman in my most recent education.
                I am proficient in Microsoft Office with advanced Excel Certificate.
