               As a child, I had a turbulant beginning.  My family lived in Alabama, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas and Colorado.
               At 16 I moved out on my own.  I finished high school at Wichita West High School.
               As an adult I have learned through DNA, that I have 2 additional siblings.  We have all met and keep in touch.
               My husband, Marc and I have been foster parents since 2009 and have had 19 children in our home, mostly sibling groups.
               We started foster care so that we could honor the people that were there to show me love when I needed it most.
               We have been married 35 years and have two grown children of our own.

                While still in High School I was hired on at American Telephone & Telegraph.  I worked in Kansas until AT&T was broken up into the "Baby Bells"
                Then the name of the company was SouthWestern Bell Telephone, they transferred me to Lubbock, Texas where I worked, met Marc, got married had two
                children and then quit and stayed home for 10 years.  In 1991, I went back to work for SouthWestern Bell Telephone which later became SBC Corp.
                Then SBC bought AT&T and took the original name back.  during that time was able to get my College Degree in Business Administraation.
                I retired in 2017 with 27 years service.

                Now I have been retired for two years and I am ready to work in the programming field.  Lubbock Coding Academy has opened my eyes to the programming/
                development world and it is a good place.  We have covered alot of material in the last 8 months and I plan to use this information in my new career as a "Full Stack" developer.
                I am still young and plan to work another 15 years.
